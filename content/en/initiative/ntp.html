<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  Keeping track of time is critical for servers and clients on the Internet. NTP is how the Internet keeps track of time. Since NTP implementations are so critical and they're on the network, it's important that they be secure.
</p>

<p>
  The most popular NTP implementations today are written in C and thus not memory safe. We're aiming to fix that.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Milestone 1: The <a href="https://github.com/memorysafety/ntpd-rs">NTP client</a> is ready for use! This work was done by <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/">Tweede golf</a> under contract with ISRG's Prossimo project.</li>
  <li>Milestone 2: The <a href="https://github.com/memorysafety/ntpd-rs">NTP server</a> is ready for use! This work was done by <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/">Tweede golf</a> under contract with ISRG's Prossimo project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>
  Work on Milestone 3, adding <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2020/08/everything-you-need-to-know-about-network-time-security/">Network Time Security (NTS)</a> support to both the NTP server and client, has begun. This work is also being done by <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/">Tweede golf</a> under contract with ISRG's Prossimo project.
