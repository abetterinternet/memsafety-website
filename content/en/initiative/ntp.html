<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  Keeping track of time is critical for servers and clients on the Internet. NTP is how the Internet keeps track of time. Since NTP implementations are so
  critical and they're on the network, it's important that they be secure.
</p>

<p>
  The most popular NTP implementations today are written in C and thus not memory safe. We're aiming to fix that.
</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>
  We have prepared a plan for a client-side and server-side NTP implementation in Rust. Contractors are ready to start work as soon as it is funded.
