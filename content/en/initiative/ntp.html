<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  Keeping track of time is critical for servers and clients on the Internet. NTP is how the Internet keeps track of time. Since NTP implementations are so
  critical and they're on the network, it's important that they be secure.
</p>

<p>
  The most popular NTP implementations today are written in C and thus not memory safe. We're aiming to fix that.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<p>
We have signed a contract with <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/">Tweede golf</a> to implement Milestone 1 of our <a href="/initiative/ntp/ntp-work-plan/">work plan</a>. Work started on April 1, 2022.
</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>
  We will continue to refine our plans for work on additional milestones while we follow progress on the first milestone.
