<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  Keeping track of time is critical for servers and clients on the Internet. NTP is how the Internet keeps track of time. Since NTP implementations are so critical and they're on the network, it's important that they be secure.
</p>

<p>
  The most popular NTP implementations today are written in C and thus not memory safe. We're aiming to fix that.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Milestone 1 Complete: The <a href="https://github.com/memorysafety/ntpd-rs">NTP client</a> is ready for use! This work was done by <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/">Tweede golf</a> under contract with ISRG's Prossimo project.</li>
  <li>Milestone 2 Complete: The <a href="https://github.com/memorysafety/ntpd-rs">NTP server</a> is ready for use! This work was done by <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/">Tweede golf</a> under contract with ISRG's Prossimo project.</li>
  <li>Milestone 3 Complete: <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2020/08/everything-you-need-to-know-about-network-time-security/">Network Time Security (NTS)</a> is fully implemented.</li>
  <li>Milestone 4 Complete: A third party security audit performed by <a href="https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security</a> was <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/94/report-ntp-security-audit">completed</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>The software is ready for production use and Prossimo's work here is done. Tweede Golf is the new home for ntpd-rs, we thank them for all of their great work!</p>
