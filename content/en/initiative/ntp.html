<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  Keeping track of time is critical for servers and clients on the Internet. NTP is how the Internet keeps track of time. Since NTP implementations are so critical and they're on the network, it's important that they be secure.
</p>

<p>
  The most popular NTP implementations today are written in C and thus not memory safe. We're aiming to fix that.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<p>
Work on the client, server, and <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2020/08/everything-you-need-to-know-about-network-time-security/">NTS</a> support is complete and ready for production deployment.
</p>

<p>
The work was done by <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/">Tweede golf</a> under contract with ISRG's Prossimo project.
</p>

<p>
A third party security audit performed by <a href="https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security</a> was <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/94/report-ntp-security-audit">completed</a>.
</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>Prossimo's work here is done. Tweede Golf's <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/en/pendulum">Project Pendulum</a> is the new home for ntpd-rs, we thank them for all of their great work!</p>
