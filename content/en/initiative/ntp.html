<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  Keeping track of time is critical for servers and clients on the Internet. NTP is how the Internet keeps track of time. Since NTP implementations are so critical and they're on the network, it's important that they be secure.
</p>

<p>
  The most popular NTP implementations today are written in C and thus not memory safe. We're aiming to fix that.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<p>Work on Milestone 1 of our <a href="/initiative/ntp/ntp-work-plan/">work plan</a> is complete! The <a href="https://github.com/memorysafety/ntpd-rs">NTP client</a> is ready for use. This work was done by <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/">Tweede golf</a> under contract with ISRG's Prossimo project.</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>
  Work on Milestone 2, the NTP server, will begin on August 15, 2022. This work will also be done by <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/">Tweede golf</a> under contract with ISRG's Prossimo project.
