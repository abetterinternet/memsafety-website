<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  Keeping track of time is critical for servers and clients on the Internet. NTP is how the Internet keeps track of time. Since NTP implementations are so critical and they're on the netwok, it's important that they be secure.
</p>

<p>
  The most popular NTP implementations today are written in C and thus not memory safe. We're aiming to fix that. We're investing in a new NTP implementation with client and server functionality for Linux and other operating systems.
