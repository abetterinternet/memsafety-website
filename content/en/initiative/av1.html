<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  Media decoders have historically been fertile ground for memory safety vulnerabilities. This is because they are complex, heavily used, and commonly processing untrusted data from networks.
</p>

<p>
  AV1 is set to become one of the most important media formats on the Internet. As it becomes more widely used, we want people to have access to a decoder that is as memory safe as reasonably possible while delivering great performance. No such encoder exists today. We intend to build one.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<p>
  We've engaged the team at <a href="https://immunant.com/">Immunant</a> as well as veteran media codec expert Frank Bossen to work on our decoder, named rav1d, starting on March 1, 2023.
</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>
  The team is hard at work!
</p>

<p>
  Milestones 1-4 of our <a href="/initiative/av1/av1-work-plan/">work plan</a> are funded. We're seeking additional funding to complete the remaining milestones.
