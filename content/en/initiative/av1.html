<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  Media decoders have historically been fertile ground for memory safety vulnerabilities. This is because they are complex, heavily used, and commonly processing untrusted data from networks.
</p>

<p>
  AV1 is set to become one of the most important media formats on the Internet. As it becomes more widely used, we want people to have access to a decoder that is as memory safe as reasonably possible.
