<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  Media decoders have historically been fertile ground for memory safety vulnerabilities. This is because they are complex, heavily used, and commonly processing untrusted data from networks.
</p>

<p>
  AV1 is set to become one of the most important media formats on the Internet. As it becomes more widely used, we want people to have access to a decoder that is as memory safe as reasonably possible while delivering great performance. No such decoder exists today. We are building one.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<p>
  We've engaged the team at <a href="https://immunant.com/">Immunant</a> as well as veteran media codec expert Frank Bossen to work on our decoder, named <a href="https://github.com/memorysafety/rav1d">rav1d</a>. Work started on March 1, 2023.
</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>
  The initial release of rav1d is nearly ready as of July 2024. The code is fully functional and memory safe, only some final stretch optimization work remains.
