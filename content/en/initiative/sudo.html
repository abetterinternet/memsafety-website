<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  The sudo and su utilities mediate a critical privilege boundary on just about every open source operating system that powers the Internet. Unfortunately, these utilities have a long history of memory safety issues.
</p>

<p>
  By rewriting sudo and su in Rust we can make sure they don't suffer from any more memory safety vulnerabilities. We're going to get it done.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<p>
In December of 2022 we funded a joint development effort between <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/">Tweede Golf</a> and <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/">Ferrous Systems</a> to rewrite sudo and su in Rust.
</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>
  Work started in December of 2022 and is planned to conclude in September of 2023. You can follow development by watching the <a href="https://github.com/memorysafety/sudo-rs">GitHub repository</a>.
