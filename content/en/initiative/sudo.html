<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  The sudo and su utilities mediate a critical privilege boundary on just about every open source operating system that powers the Internet. Unfortunately, these utilities have a long history of memory safety issues.
</p>

<p>
  By rewriting sudo and su in Rust we can make sure they don't suffer from any more memory safety vulnerabilities. By leaving out less commonly used features we can reduce attack surface.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<p>
In December of 2022 we funded a joint development effort between <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/">Tweede Golf</a> and <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/">Ferrous Systems</a> to rewrite sudo and su in Rust</a>.
</p>

<p>
As of August 2023, the first <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/sudo-first-stable-release/">stable release</a> is out, give it a shot!
</p>

<p>
We'd like to thank Todd Miller, maintainer of the original sudo utility, for his advice and guidance on our implementation.
</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>
  We're currently raising funding for additional enterprise features.
</p>
