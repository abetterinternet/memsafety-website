<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  If we're going to move critical software infrastructure to memory safe code we're going to need to make some investments in tools. It needs to be as easy as possible to build safer software.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<ol>
  <li>We contracted with Rémy Rakic to spend six months improving Rust compile times, from January to September of 2022.</li>
  <li>We have signed a six-month contract with Ferrous Systems to make various improvements to the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen">bindgen</a> tool. Work will begin within the next few months.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>
  We plan to extend Rémy Rakic's contract to improve Rust compile times by an additional six months.
