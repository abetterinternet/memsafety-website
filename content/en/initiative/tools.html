<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  If we're going to move critical software infrastructure to memory safe code we're going to need to make some investments in tools. It needs to be as easy as possible to build safer software.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<ol>
  <li>We contracted with Rémy Rakic to improve Rust compile times from January 2022 through September 2023.</li>
  <li>We contracted with Ferrous Systems to make various improvements to the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen">bindgen</a> tool. Work started in August of 2022. So far progress has been made on the following items:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/issues/2167">allowlist entries like allowlist_function show no warning when they don't match anything</a> (fix merged)</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/issues/1743">sort all items emitted based on their item type</a> (fix merged)</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/issues/2094">Support _Noreturn, [[noreturn]], __attribute__((noreturn))</a> (partial fixed merge, PRs for the rest open)</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/issues/1090">Generate C code to export static inline functions</a> (work in progress)</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/issues/564">Is it always necessary to put every function definition in a separate extern block?</a> (work in progress)</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/issues/2227">Multiple definitions when a pointer gets typedef’d to the same name as a struct</a> (work starting soon)</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/pull/1740">Rewrite Clang interface to use C++ libtooling API instead of libclang</a> (work starting soon)</li>
      </ul>
</ol>
