<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>The Linux kernel is at the heart of today's Internet. Unfortunately, because it's written in C, it has a long history of memory safety vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>
  Securing the Linux kernel is imperative if we want a secure Internet. One of the best ways we can do that is by making it possible to write Linux kernel
  modules (e.g. drivers) in a memory safe language. To be honest, when we first starting thinking about how to bring memory safety to the Linux kernel, the
  problem seemed intractable. Then we learned that about the <a href="https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux">Rust for Linux</a> project.
</p>

<p>
  Miguel Ojeda and Alex Gaynor have done incredible work, both technically and in terms of making the case for Rust in the Linux kernel. We're currently funding Miguel to work on Rust for Linux full time. See the links below for getting up to speed on this work.
