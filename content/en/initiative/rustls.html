<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  The story of our work with <a href="https://github.com/ctz/rustls">Rustls</a> begins with another piece of software, OpenSSL. OpenSSL is a ubiquitous TLS library, used in a large percentage of all devices connected to the Internet. Unfortunately, it's written in C and has a long history of memory safety vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p>
  It's important for the security of the Internet that we move away from TLS libraries that aren't memory safe. It's highly unlikely that we can get the OpenSSL project to move away from C so we need to work on a memory safe alternative and get the Internet's critical software infrastructure to make the switch.
</p>

<p>
  Fortunately, there is an excellent alternative to OpenSSL for many use cases. Rustls is a <a href="https://github.com/ctz/rustls/blob/main/audit/TLS-01-report.pdf">high-quality</a> TLS implementation written in Rust, a memory safe language. We believe Rustls represents the future of TLS implementation on the Internet.

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<h3>Current Engagements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Daniel McCarney is currently working full time on Rustls via a contract with Prossimo that started on March 1, 2023.</li>
  <li>Joe Birr-Pixton is currently working full time on Rustls via a contract with Prossimo that started on June 12, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Past Engagements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Dirkjan Ochtman via contract with Prossimo, March 2021 through October 2021.</li>
  <li>ISRG engineer Jacob Hoffman-Andrews developed a <a href="https://github.com/rustls/rustls-ffi">C API for Rustls</a> that existing C-based projects can use to make their TLS implementation memory safe.</li>
  <li>Joe Birr-Pixton via contract with Prossimo, December 2022 through January 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>
  We are currently raising funds to make <a href="/initiative/rustls/rustls-work-plan/">further improvements</a> to Rustls.
