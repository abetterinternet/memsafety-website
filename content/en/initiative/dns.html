<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  DNS is as critical as Internet systems get. Just about every client and server depends on making frequent DNS lookups. DNS implementations need to be secure.
</p>

<p>
  While there are many DNS implementations out there, including some memory safe ones, there are no open source, high performance, memory safe, fully recursive DNS resolvers. Until that exists, many DNS operators will continue to deploy DNS software written in languages that are not memory safe, putting critical Internet infrastructure at risk.
</p>

<p>
  We believe there is strong demand for such an implementation, and ISRG's <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> certificate authority will be amongst the first to deploy it.
</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>
  We are working with several potential partners who are interested in building an open source, high performance, memory safe, fully recursive DNS resolver. We hope to publish a development plan shortly.
