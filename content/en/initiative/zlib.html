<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  zlib is a data compression library that has been around since 1995. It's quite useful and as a result it's widely used. Unfortunately it has a history of memory safety vulnerabilities, a common phenomenon for compression libraries written in C/C++.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<p>We contracted with <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/">Tweede Golf</a> in December of 2023 for an <a href="https://github.com/memorysafety/zlib-rs/">initial implementation</a> based on <a href="https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng">zlib-ng</a>, with a focus on maintaining excellent performance while introducing memory safety.</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>
  We're currently seeking funding to complete work necessary to make the initial implementation ready for production.
